# Perceptron

This repository contains an implementation of a Perceptron model in Python.

## Description

The Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network and one of the simplest forms of a neural network model. It is used for binary classification tasks. 
This specific implementation of the perceptron model currently only focuses on sample by sample based learning rather than a more vectorised approach.
